# JManhunt

JManhunt is a deeply configurable Paper plugin for 26.2+ Manhunts. It comes
with a lean world reset engine, compass tracking, placeholders, statistics,
and a variety of built-in actions and custom modifiers.

## Key Features

- **Deep configurability** — Toggle built-in mechanics on or off, or create
  entirely new gameplay through easy-to-use custom modifiers.
- **World reset engine** — Grid-based single-world manhunt engine with
  persistent spiral cell assignment and automatic End resets.
- **Compass tracking** — Hunter compass with configurable refresh and
  right-click behavior.
- **Placeholders & statistics** — Career statistics with PlaceholderAPI
  support.
- **Built-in challenges** — No-jump, one-heart, and lucky-blocks challenges.
