# Placeholders

JManhunt provides built-in PlaceholderAPI identifiers. All placeholders must
be used with the prefix `%jmanhunt_<placeholder>%` (e.g.
`%jmanhunt_total_kills%`, `%jmanhunt_time_as_hunter%`).

Formatting, aliases, and enabled/disabled state are configured in `config.yml`
under the `placeholders` section. Values are resolved for the player passed by
PlaceholderAPI.

## Placeholder List

## Configuration

Each placeholder can be individually enabled or disabled and formatted in
`config.yml`:

```yaml
placeholders:
  total_kills:
    enabled: true
    format: "{value}"
```

The `{value}` placeholder is replaced with the built-in value. Formatting uses
the selected `text-format` from `config.yml` (either `minimessage` or
`legacy`).
